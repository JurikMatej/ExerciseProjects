# Matej Jurik - Exercise Projects

## About

These are the projects I made to __learn__ a new __language__, new __concept__ or to just pass time.  
Each respective directory at this level of this repository _used to be a separate **project repo**_,  
but I decided to group them together here to prevent my GitHub profile from bloating with  
not-so-interesting repositories.  

## Important

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a '_gallery_' of (mini?) side/test/exercise projects  
I created at some point of time.  
These projects are __not to be cloned__ but only to be reviewed to __see__ what I __learned__, __made__  
and am capable of building.
